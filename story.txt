Once upon a time, there's a beaver called Cody. He was swimming happily in a dam. 
All of a sudden, he hit the wall, and shout, "oh dam/damn!". 

To Cody's suprprise, he had run into a giant wall made of string cheese. How
will he ever over come this roadblock?

To overcome the road block, Cody ate the wall

After he ate the wall of string cheese, Cody was very tired and decided to take a nap on a log. Cody dreamt of eating more string cheese in his nap. He was very happy.

The dream let Cody discovered his passion for cheese, so he has been having cheese daily ever since.
